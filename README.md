 Simple Shell 
A simple UNIX command interpreter written as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX.

Description 
Shellex is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

Invocation 
Usage: shellex [filename]

To invoke shellex, compile all .c files in the repository and run the resulting executable:

gcc *.c -o shellex
./shellex
Shellex can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If shellex is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

Example:

$ echo "echo 'hello'" | ./shellex
'hello'
$
If shellex is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by isatty(3)), an interactive shell is opened. When executing interactively, shellex displays the prompt $ when it is ready to read a command.

Example:

$./shellex
$
Alternatively, if command line arguments are supplied upon invocation, shellex treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands. The supplied file should contain one command per line. Shellex runs each of the commands contained in the file in order before exiting.

Example:

$ cat test
echo 'hello'
$ ./shellex test
'hello'
$
Environment ðŸŒ³
Upon invocation, shellex receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This environment is an array of name-value strings describing variables in the format NAME=VALUE. A few key environmental variables are:

HOME
The home directory of the current user and the default directory argument for the cd builtin command.

$ echo "echo $HOME" | ./shellex
/home/vagrant
PWD
The current working directory as set by the cd command.

$ echo "echo $PWD" | ./shellex
/home/vagrant/ALX/simple_shell
OLDPWD
The previous working directory as set by the cd command.

$ echo "echo $OLDPWD" | ./shellex
/home/vagrant/ALX/printf
